# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DeFiGuard Risk is an AI-powered, multi-chain portfolio analysis and automated rebalancing tool that provides comprehensive risk assessment of crypto holdings and enables one-click execution of complex cross-chain rebalancing strategies. The system follows a "Fetch, Analyze, Act" workflow to consolidate portfolio data across multiple blockchains, perform sophisticated risk analysis using advanced financial models, and execute automated rebalancing through cross-chain transactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Portfolio Data Aggregation

**User Story:** As a DeFi investor, I want to connect my wallet and view all my token balances across multiple blockchains in a single interface, so that I can get a comprehensive view of my portfolio without manually checking each chain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects their wallet THEN the system SHALL fetch token balances from all supported chains using the Coinbase CDP Data API
2. WHEN portfolio data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL display all token holdings in a unified interface showing token name, symbol, balance, and USD value
3. WHEN the portfolio view loads THEN the system SHALL support at least 5 major blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
4. IF the CDP API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and retry mechanism
5. WHEN portfolio data is displayed THEN the system SHALL refresh balances automatically every 30 seconds

### Requirement 2: Historical Data Integration

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want access to historical price and on-chain data for my assets, so that I can perform meaningful risk analysis based on past performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes a portfolio THEN it SHALL query a custom Subgraph on The Graph to retrieve historical price data for all held assets
2. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL fetch at least 90 days of price history for risk calculations
3. IF historical data is missing for an asset THEN the system SHALL exclude that asset from risk calculations and notify the user
4. WHEN data is retrieved from The Graph THEN the system SHALL cache results for 1 hour to optimize performance
5. WHEN historical data is processed THEN the system SHALL handle data gaps and inconsistencies gracefully

### Requirement 3: Advanced Risk Analysis

**User Story:** As an investor, I want sophisticated risk metrics calculated for my portfolio using proven financial models, so that I can understand my true risk exposure beyond simple price movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN portfolio analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL calculate Sortino Ratio, Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and Maximum Drawdown using Riskfolio-Lib
2. WHEN risk metrics are computed THEN the system SHALL provide risk scores for individual assets and the overall portfolio
3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify the riskiest assets and suggest diversification improvements
4. IF insufficient data exists for risk calculation THEN the system SHALL provide alternative basic metrics and warn the user
5. WHEN risk analysis updates THEN the system SHALL recalculate metrics whenever portfolio composition changes

### Requirement 4: AI-Powered Natural Language Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about my portfolio in natural language and receive intelligent insights, so that I can get actionable advice without needing to interpret complex financial data myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a natural language question THEN the Chainlink MCP Server SHALL process the query and provide relevant portfolio insights
2. WHEN the AI agent responds THEN it SHALL provide specific, actionable recommendations based on the user's actual portfolio data
3. WHEN asked about risk THEN the system SHALL explain risk metrics in plain language with context about the user's holdings
4. IF the AI cannot answer a question THEN it SHALL explain what information is needed and suggest alternative queries
5. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL include confidence levels and reasoning behind suggestions

### Requirement 5: Automated Portfolio Rebalancing

**User Story:** As a DeFi investor, I want to execute complex cross-chain portfolio rebalancing with a single click, so that I can optimize my allocation without manually performing dozens of transactions across different chains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI suggests a rebalancing strategy THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed transaction plan showing all required swaps and transfers
2. WHEN a user approves rebalancing THEN the system SHALL execute all necessary transactions using Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain operations
3. WHEN rebalancing is initiated THEN the system SHALL handle gas fee optimization across all involved chains
4. IF any transaction in the rebalancing fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms and clear error reporting
5. WHEN rebalancing is complete THEN the system SHALL update the portfolio view and provide a summary of executed transactions

### Requirement 6: Multi-Chain Transaction Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle all the complexity of cross-chain transactions automatically, so that I don't need to manually bridge assets or manage multiple wallets across different networks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cross-chain rebalancing is required THEN the system SHALL use Chainlink CCIP to securely transfer assets between supported chains
2. WHEN executing swaps THEN the system SHALL integrate with major DEXs on each chain to find optimal exchange rates
3. WHEN transactions are submitted THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates for all cross-chain operations
4. IF cross-chain transactions are delayed THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion times and allow users to track progress
5. WHEN all transactions complete THEN the system SHALL verify the final portfolio matches the target allocation within acceptable tolerance

### Requirement 7: Security and Risk Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious investor, I want the system to protect my assets and provide clear information about transaction risks, so that I can make informed decisions about automated rebalancing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users connect wallets THEN the system SHALL never request private keys or seed phrases
2. WHEN transactions are prepared THEN the system SHALL show detailed previews including gas costs, slippage, and potential MEV risks
3. WHEN rebalancing is suggested THEN the system SHALL require explicit user approval before executing any transactions
4. IF unusual market conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL warn users and suggest delaying rebalancing
5. WHEN handling user funds THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate slippage protection and maximum gas limits

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respond quickly and handle multiple concurrent users, so that I can get timely portfolio insights and execute time-sensitive rebalancing operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading portfolio data THEN the system SHALL display results within 5 seconds for wallets with up to 100 tokens
2. WHEN performing risk analysis THEN calculations SHALL complete within 10 seconds for standard portfolio sizes
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN it SHALL maintain performance with up to 100 concurrent users
4. IF API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies and user notifications
5. WHEN system load is high THEN critical functions like portfolio viewing SHALL maintain priority over background analysis
